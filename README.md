I have completed the assignment task and attached the GitHub public repository link for the task. 

I have used React, vite, html, css and JavaScript for the development 
I have also used react router for page navigation. 
Tailwind CSS library is used for styling. 

To setup and run the project 
Use "npm install" to install node modules 
Use "npm run dev"  by default it'll run on localhost:5000

Let me know if there are any problems regarding starting the project. 

Thanks and regards,

Ashutosh Kaushal
